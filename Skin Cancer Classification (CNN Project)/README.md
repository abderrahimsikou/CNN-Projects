# Skin Cancer Classification (CNN Project)

This project aims to use deep learning [CNN] to detect Skin Cancer.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras 
- NumPy

## Dataset Structure

The data was download from kaggle and then upload it to google drive and then
connect google drive with google colab.
