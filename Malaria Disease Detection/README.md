# Malaria Disease Detection

This project aims to use deep learning [CNN] to predict malaria infection of blood cells.
The project was developed using Google Colab, and data from the kaggle platform was used

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Keras & TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Dataset

The data was taken from kaggle by connecting kaggle to google colab,without downloading
the data

## Connect Kaggle to Google Colab

To upload data from Kaggle to Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Download API file from Kaggle**:
   - Go to your Kaggle account.
   - From your account settings, find the “API” section and click “Create a new API token.”
   - The file "kaggle.json" will be downloaded.
After that, copy the username and key.
